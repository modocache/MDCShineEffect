## Acknowledgements

This concept (and the code itself) was heavily influenced by
[Ben Schierman](https://github.com/subdigital) and his [NSScreencast on the
matter](http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/40-shine-effect). If you
haven't heard of [NSScreencast](http://nsscreencast.com), I highly
recommend you subscribe. As far as OS X/iOS development resources go,
it's the best money you'll ever spend.
